# ðŸ¤– PR-Agent

This repository is inspired by the excellent [mcp-course](https://github.com/huggingface/mcp-course) project from Hugging Face.

The primary goal of this repository is to reimplement the system using the **LangGraph** framework and allow the use of **custom LLMs** (e.g., OpenAI, Mistral, Gemini, etc.), rather than being restricted to **Claude Code** as in the original implementation.
